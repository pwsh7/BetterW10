# Backstory

The year is 2016 and peak Microsoft Windows has been reached. Despite the numerous security enhancements and newly added features in Windows 10, the prevalence of ads and annoyances plaguing the operating system renders it borderline unusable and breeds suspicion and hostility from users (or from me at least).

Real talk though, this shit is getting out of control. Even [Ars Technica agrees with me](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/microsoft-put-gross-ads-in-windows-explorer-and-i-dont-have-the-energy-to-be-angry/) and honestly that's all the validation I need. Not to worry though, at least now you can boot straight into a Bash shell now and forget Windows exists until you want to play Rocket League.
